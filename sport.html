    <center><h2> COMPETITIVE SPORTS</h2></center>
    <center><img src= "sport1.jpg" width= "400" height= "300"></center>


<center><h2> What is Sport?</h2></center>
<p1> Sport includes all forms of competitive physical activity or games which, through casual or organized participation, at least in part
    aim to use, maintain or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants, and in some cases, entertainment
    for spectators. Sports can bring positive results to one's physical health. Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single 
    contestants, through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants, either in teams or competing as individuals. In certain sports 
    such as racing, many contestants may compete, simultaneously or consecutively, with one winner; in others, the contest (a match) is 
    between two sides, each attempting to exceed the other. Some sports allow a "tie" or "draw", in which there is no single winner; others
    provide tie-breaking methods to ensure one winner and one loser. A number of contests may be arranged in a tournament producing a champion. 
    Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season, followed in some cases by playoffs.</p1>

<p> Sport is usually governed by a set of rules or customs, which serve to ensure fair competition, and allow consistent adjudication 
    of the winner. Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring goals or crossing a line first. It can also be determined
    by judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance, including objective or subjective measures such as technical
    performance or artistic impression.</p>

<center><h2> What is the most popular Sports?</h2></center>
<p1> Sports are popular for a number of reasons. Keeping healthy, for example, is often cited as a reason for participating in sports.
    Others will tell you that they do sports for recreational purposes. Sports are even more popular with people who do not necessarily
    participate in them, but love being spectators. Since time immemorial, people have been awed and inspired by extraordinary human
    beings who are able to perform tremendous athletic feats. Here is a brief discussion of the most popular sports in the world.</p1>


<h2> 1. Football/ Soccer</h2>

<center><img src= "sport3.jpg" width= "400" height= "300"></center>
<p1> Football, also called association football or soccer, is a game involving two teams of 11 players who try to maneuver the ball into 
    the other team's goal without using their hands or arms. The team that scores more goals wins. Football is the world's most popular 
    ball game in numbers of participants and spectators.</p1>
<p> One reason for football’s popularity is that unlike other sports that require expensive equipment, all you need to play football is a
     ball and your foot. Hence, anyone, rich or poor, can enjoy the sport. It is played all over the world, but is particularly popular 
     in Europe, Central and South America, and Africa.</p>
<p> Association football, more commonly known as football or soccer, is a team sport played with a spherical ball between two teams of 11
    players. It is played by approximately 250 million players in over 200 countries and dependencies, making it the world's most popular
    sport. The game is played on a rectangular field called a pitch with a goal at each end. The object of the game is to outscore the
    opposition by moving the ball beyond the goal line into the opposing goal. The team with the higher number of goals wins the game.
    Football is played in accordance with a set of rules known as the Laws of the Game. The ball is 68–70 cm (27–28 in) in circumference
    and known as the football. The two teams each compete to get the ball into the other team's goal (between the posts and under the bar),
    thereby scoring a goal. The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner; if both teams have scored an equal
    number of goals then the game is a draw. Each team is led by a captain who has only one official responsibility as mandated by the
    Laws of the Game: to represent their team in the coin toss prior to kick-off or penalty kicks.
<p> 
    Players are not allowed to touch the ball with hands or arms while it is in play, except for the goalkeepers within the penalty area.
    Other players mainly use their feet to strike or pass the ball, but may also use any other part of their body except the hands and the
    arms. The team that scores most goals by the end of the match wins. If the score is level at the end of the game, either a draw is
    declared or the game goes into extra time or a penalty shootout depending on the format of the competition.</p>

<p> As a sport lover, football is my favourite. I have watched so many football matches every year.</p>

<h2> 2. Tennis</h2>

<center><img src= "sport4.png" width= "500" height= "300"></center>
<p1> Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players 
    each (doubles). Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over 
    or around a net and into the opponent's court. The object of the game is to maneuver the ball in such a way that the opponent 
    is not able to play a valid return. The player who is unable to return the ball will not gain a point, while the opposite player will.
    Pro tennis players, like Roger Federer and Serena Williams, are now household names around the world.</p1>

    <p> Tennis is played by millions of recreational players and is also a popular worldwide spectator sport. The four Grand Slam 
        tournaments (also referred to as the Majors) are especially popular: the Australian Open played on hard courts, the French 
        Open played on red clay courts, Wimbledon played on grass courts, and the US Open also played on hard courts.</p>

    <p> Part of the appeal of tennis stems from the simplicity of equipment required for play. Beginners need only a racket and balls.</p>

<h2> 3. Basketball</h2>

<center><img src= "sport5.jpg" width= "500" height= "300"></center>
<p1> Basketball, colloquially referred to as hoops, is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing
     one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) 
     in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at 
     each end of the court) while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop. A field goal is worth two points, 
     unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three. After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or 
     designated to shoot a technical foul is given one, two or three one-point free throws. The team with the most points at the end of 
     the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.</p1>

    <p> Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling) or by passing it to a teammate, both of which require 
        considerable skill. On offense, players may use a variety of shots—the lay-up, the jump shot, or a dunk; on defense, they may steal 
        the ball from a dribbler, intercept passes, or block shots; either offense or defense may collect a rebound, that is, a missed shot
        that bounces from rim or backboard. It is a violation to lift or drag one's pivot foot without dribbling the ball, to carry it, or
        to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling.</p>

    <p>
        The five players on each side fall into five playing positions. The tallest player is usually the center, the second-tallest and 
        strongest is the power forward, a slightly shorter but more agile player is the small forward, and the shortest players or the best 
        ball handlers are the shooting guard and the point guard, who implements the coach's game plan by managing the execution of offensive 
        and defensive plays (player positioning). Informally, players may play three-on-three, two-on-two, and one-on-one.
        The Federation of International Basketball Associations (FIBA) estimates that a minimum of 450 million people play the sport around 
        the world, be it recreationally or through structured competitions. Legendary figures in the world of basketball such as 
        Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant, have aided the rise in global popularity of the sport from its American roots.

<h2> 4. Badminton</h2>

<center><img src= "sport6.jpg" width= "500" height= "300"></center>
<p1>Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net. Although it may be played with larger teams, 
    the most common forms of the game are "singles" (with one player per side) and "doubles" (with two players per side). Badminton is 
    often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach; formal games are played on a rectangular indoor court. Points are 
    scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the opposing side's half of the court.</p1>

    <p> Each side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes over the net. Play ends once the shuttlecock has struck the floor 
        or if a fault has been called by the umpire, service judge, or (in their absence) the opposing side. The shuttlecock is a feathered 
        or (in informal matches) plastic projectile which flies differently from the balls used in many other sports. In particular, 
        the feathers create much higher drag, causing the shuttlecock to decelerate more rapidly. Shuttlecocks also have a high top 
        speed compared to the balls in other racquet sports. The flight of the shuttlecock gives the sport its distinctive nature.
        For equipment, Badminton rules restrict the design and size of racquets and shuttlecocks.</p>

    <p> It might come as a surprise to some people that badminton is among the world’s top 10 most participated sports. But badminton is an 
        extremely popular indoor sport, which is played regularly by an estimated 220 million people around the world. It is particularly 
        popular in Asia, with many of the best players ever to grace the game hailing from the continent.</p>

<h2> 5. Hockey</h2>
<p1> Hockey is a sport in which two teams play against each other by trying to manoeuvre a ball or a puck into the opponent's goal using 
    a hockey stick. There are many types of hockey such as bandy, field hockey, ice hockey and rink hockey. In most of the world, the term
    hockey by itself refers to field hockey, while in Canada, the United States, Russia and most of Eastern and Northern Europe, the term
    usually refers to ice hockey.</p1>

<center><p><li><b> Field Hockey</b></li></p></center>

<center><img src= "sport7.jpg" width= "500" height= "300"></center>
        <p> Field hockey is a widely played team sport of the hockey family. The game can be played on grass, watered turf, artificial turf
            or synthetic field, as well as an indoor boarded surface. Each team plays with ten field players and a goalkeeper. Players use
            sticks made of wood, carbon fibre, fibre glass, or a combination of carbon fibre and fibre glass in different quantities, to hit
            a round, hard, plastic hockey ball. The length of the hockey stick is based on the player's individual height: the top of the
            stick usually comes to the players hip, and taller players typically have longer sticks. The sticks have a round side and a
            flat side, and only the flat face of the stick is allowed to be used. Use of the other side results in a foul. Goalies often have
            a different design of stick, although they can also use an ordinary field hockey stick. The specific goal-keeping sticks have
            another curve at the end of the stick, which is to give it more surface area to block the ball. The uniform consists of shin guards,
            shoes, shorts or a skirt, a mouthguard and a jersey.</p>
            <p>The game is played globally, particularly in parts of Western Europe, South Asia, Southern Africa, Australia, New Zealand, 
                Argentina, and parts of the United States, primarily New England and the Mid-Atlantic states. This fast paced sport is played
                by men and women in over 100 countries on 5 continents around the world. A firm favorite at the Olympic Games, field hockey
                is a highly technical sport, played by 10 outfield players plus a goalkeeper and its rules differ from the Ice hockey
                variation of the sport.</p>

<center><p><li><b> Ice Hockey</b></li></p></center>

<center><img src= "sport8.jpg" width= "500" height= "300"></center>
        <p> Ice hockey is a contact team sport played on ice, usually in a rink, in which two teams of skaters use their sticks to shoot a 
            vulcanized rubber puck into their opponent's net to score goals. The sport is known to be fast-paced and physical, with teams 
            usually fielding six players at a time: one goaltender, and five players who skate the span of the ice trying to control the puck 
            and score goals against the opposing team. Ice hockey is most popular in Canada, central and eastern Europe, the Nordic countries,
            Russia, and the United States. Ice hockey is the official national winter sport of Canada</p>             

<center><p><li><b> Roller Hockey</b></li></p></center>  

<center><img src= "sport9.jpg" width= "500" height= "300"></center>
        <p> Roller hockey (in British English), rink hockey (in American English) or quad hockey is a team sport played on roller skates.
            Two five-man teams (four skaters and one goalkeeper) try to drive the ball with their sticks into the opponents' goal. The ball
            can only be put in motion by a stick, not the skate, otherwise a foul will be stated. The game has two 25-minute halves, with
            15-minute halftime intermission, plus up to two 5-minute golden goal (a.k.a. "sudden death") periods to settle ties with the
            clock stopping when the ball becomes dead. If the tie persists, a penalty shootout will determine the winner.
            Players – including the goalie – use quad skates, whereas inline skates are used in inline hockey. Excessive contact between
            players is forbidden in rink hockey, unlike inline hockey.</p>
