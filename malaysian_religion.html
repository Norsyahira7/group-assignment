<h3 align="center"> Malaysia is a multicultural and multiconfessional country, whose official religion is Islam. As of the 2010 Population 
    and Housing Census, 61.3 percent of the population practices Islam; 19.8 percent Buddhism; 9.2 percent Christianity; 6.3 percent Hinduism; 
    and 3.4 percent traditional Chinese religions. The remainder is accounted for by other faiths, including Animism, Folk religion, Sikhism, 
    Baháʼí Faith and other belief systems. <p/>
    Islam, Malaysia’s official religion, is followed by about three-fifths of the population. Islam is one of the most important factors 
    distinguishing a Malay from a non-Malay, and, by law, all Malays are Muslim. The Chinese do not have a dominant religion; many, while 
    subscribing to the moral precepts of Confucianism, follow Buddhism or Daoism; a small minority adheres to various denominations of 
    Christianity. Most of the Indians and Sri Lankans practice Hinduism, while the Pakistanis are predominantly Muslim. Some Indians are 
    Christian. The Sikhs, originally from the Indian state of Punjab, largely adhere to their own religion, Sikhism.</h3>

<p1><b> Islam in Malaysia is represented by the Shafi'i version of Sunni theology and the practice of any other form of the religion 
    (such as Shia Islam) is heavily restricted by the government. The constitution makes Malaysia a secular country and guarantees freedom 
    of religion, while establishing Islam as the "religion of the Federation" to symbolise its importance to Malaysian society.</b></p>
    <p><b> Muslims believe that Allah is One and the purpose of life is to worship God. Muslims also believe that Islam is a complete and universal
    version of the monotheistic beliefs of the teachings of Prophet Ibrahim a.s., Prophet Musa a.s., Prophet Isa a.s., and other prophets.
    Nabi Muhammad S.A.W. was not the founder of the new religion, but rather the restoration of the monotheistic faith of the teachings of 
    the previous prophets. Islamic tradition asserts that Judaism and Christianity reversed the revelation that God gave to these prophets 
    by changing the text or introducing false interpretations, or both.</b></p>

    <p><b> Islamic religious practices include the Pillars of Islam, which are the five responsibilities that unite Muslims into one society. 
           In addition, there is Islamic law (شريعة, syari'ah) that touches on almost all aspects of life and society. This tradition covers everything 
           from practical matters such as dietary law and banking to jihad and zakat.</b></p>

<p1><b> Chinese Folk Religion (中国 传统 民间 宗教) is a Chinese hereditary religion. It is actually a traditional culture passed down 
    from one generation to another orally. Moreover, this religion has no religious books and no institution that preserves it. Thus the 
    teachings of this religion are vague, and vary from place to place.But in general this religion supports the concept of "the good is 
    rewarded with good, the bad is rewarded with bad".</p1></b>
    <p><b> In general, Chinese religion involves 3 forms of worship, namely:</p></b>
1) Ancestor Worship. Ancestor worship is the essence of Chinese religion. It is related to the value system of Chinese society which gives high value to the nature of "obedience to parents".
<br>
2) Idolatry. The idols worshiped in this religion are too many. It consists of gods, characters in epic stories, and even historical figures. It is believed that idolatry can guarantee the "safety of daily life" (保 平安）.
<br>
3) Worship of the Mayor （拜 土地公). Commissioner of Land can be thought of as gatekeepers in the community. Usually the Chinese would build an altar for the grandfather on the floor.

<p1><b> Hinduism is a religion or philosophy that originated in the Indian subcontinent and the surrounding area. This religion is the oldest 
    known religion in the world. The main book of this religion is the Veda which is divided into four main books namely Rig Veda, Yajur Veda, 
    Sama Veda and Atharva Veda.</b></p1>
    <p><b> In the past, Hinduism was known as Ārya Dharma and people who professed this religion were known as Āryan. Their original occupation was 
    in the province of Punjab. There is no definitive opinion about the origins of the Aryans. Scholars and historians are still disputing 
    and presenting conflicting theories. Some opinions say that the Aryans came from the Arctic region, some say Central Asia, and some say 
    Mediterranean and so on. Swami Vivekananda instead asserted that the Aryans came from the Indian subcontinent and not an immigrant nation 
    from outside India. From the Punjab, however, the Aryans spread throughout North India, until the area they occupied was known as
    Āryāvarta. They then, crossed the Vindhya range and spread throughout South India. Agastya Muni is considered to be the person who has 
    brought the Āryan people to the South.</b></p>
